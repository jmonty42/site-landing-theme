I loved my time as an Aggie in Logan, Utah!

While completing my degree I worked in several labs including the Space Dynamics
Laboratory, the Center for Self-Organizing and Intelligent Systems, and the Utah Water
Research Laboratory.

I did work in fiber optic communications, computer vision, security research, and automated
flight systems.
