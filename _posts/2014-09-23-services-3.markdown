Amazon is what brought me to the Seattle area back in 2013.

At Amazon I was one of the first engineers on the team that launched Prime Now in 2014.
My contribution was implementing the end-to-end feature in the Prime Now app that enables customers
to leave a tip for the courier when placing an order.

My last year at Amazon was spent on the Package Builder Team, which was part of the Builder Tools organization.
We were responsible for maintaining and improving the build system that all of the engineers at Amazon used on 
a daily basis.
